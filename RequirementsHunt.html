<h1>We're Going On A Requirements Hunt!</h1>
<em>(With apologies to Michael Rosen)</em>

<p>
We're going on a Requirements Hunt.<br/>
We're going to catch a full one!<br/>
We're not scared.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oh no! Users! Icky, Picky Users.<br/>
We can't go through them.<br/>
We can't go around them.<br/>
We're going to have to go over them.<br/>
Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!<br/>
</p>
<p>

We're going on a Requirements Hunt.<br/>
We're going to catch a full one!<br/>
We're not scared.<br/>
</p>
<p>

Oh no! The Powerpoints! The snoring, boring Powerpoints!<br/>
We can't go around them.<br/>
We can't go over them.<br/>
We're going to have to go through them.<br/>
Next! Next! Next! Next!<br/>
</p>
<p>

We're going on a Requirements Hunt.<br/>
We're going to catch a full one!<br/>
We're not scared.<br/>
</p>
<p>

Oh no! The Accountants! The Cost controlling Accountants!<br/>
We can't go through them.<br/>
We can't go over them.<br/>
We're going to have to go around them.<br/>
Tip-toe, tip-toe, tip-toe, tip-toe.<br/>
</p>
<p>

We're going on a Requirements Hunt.<br/>
We're going to catch a full one!<br/>
We're not scared.<br/>
</p>
<p>

Oh no! A Requirement! A complete and coherent Requirement!<br/>
Quick, back around the Accountants!<br/>
Tip-toe, tip-toe, tip-toe, tip-toe.<br/>
Back through the Powerpoints!<br/>
Next! Next! Next! Next!<br/>
Back over the Users!<br/>
Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!<br/>
Back to our cubicle.<br/>
Slam the door. Oh... no door. We're doomed to failure. Just like normal.<br/>
